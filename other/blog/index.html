The increasing availability of culinary data and the advent of computational methods for their scrutiny are dramatically changing the artistic outlook towards gastronomy. Starting with a seemingly simple question, ‘Why do we eat what we eat?’, data-driven research conducted in our lab has led to interesting explorations of traditional recipes, their flavor composition, and health associations. Our investigations have revealed ‘culinary fingerprints’ of regional cuisines across the world. Application of data-driven strategies for investigating the gastronomic data has opened up exciting avenues, giving rise to an all-new field of ‘computational gastronomy’. This emerging interdisciplinary science asks questions of culinary origin to seek their answers via the compilation of culinary data and their analysis using methods of complex systems, statistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Along with complementary experimental studies, these endeavors have the potential to transform the food landscape by effectively leveraging data-driven food innovations for better health and nutrition. Computational Gastronomy is a data science which blends food with data and the power of artificial intelligence. We have an ambitious goal of creating a Computational Gastronomy Framework around the following themes and expertise. THEMATIC AREAS/EXPERTISE: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, API Development, Database/Webserver Development, Natural Language Processing, Android/iOS App Development, Novel Recipes Generation, Ayurveda Informatics, Taste/Odor Prediction, Image Processing, Food Pairing Analysis, Carbon/Water Footprinting Calculations, Food Allergens, Food \u0026 Music, and Computational Creativity.\u003c/p\u003e","author":"Anurag Sharma","metadesc":"Cooking forms the core of our cultural identity other than being the basis of nutrition and health.
